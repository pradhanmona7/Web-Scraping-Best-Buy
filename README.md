# Web-Scraping-Best-Buy
Advance Data Science Project 1 Scraping Best Buy website
Problem Definition: 
The Assignment aims to perform web scraping on the Best Buy website to extract product information such as titles, prices, and ratings. The Assignment includes web scraping, data extraction, and saving the data to a CSV file. 

**Future Scope** 
1.Recommendation Systems: By understanding which products are frequently purchased  together (e.g., through association analysis), we can build recommendation systems that  suggest related products to customers, improving their shopping experience.  
2.Customer Sentiment Analysis: The ratings and reviews data can be used for sentiment  analysis to understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for product improvement.  
3.Machine Learning: The scraped data can be used to build predictive models, such as  regression models to predict product prices based on various factors, or classification  models to predict product ratings based on product features.  
4.Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques can be applied to customer reviews to  extract valuable insights, perform topic modeling, and identify common issues or features that customers mention. 

**Methodology** 
The methodology involves web scraping Best Buy's website using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to extract product data. It includes identifying and parsing relevant HTML elements, handling exceptions, and iterating through product pages. 
Environment Setup: The project uses Python environment with necessary libraries like BeautifulSoup, pandas, NumPy and requests. 
Tools Used: Python: The primary programming language used for web scraping and data manipulation.
BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used for extracting data from web pages. 
Requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages. 
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for structuring and analyzing the scraped data. 
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data handling. 

**Handling of HTML and CSS** 
BeautifulSoup is utilized to navigate and extract data from the HTML structure of Best Buy's web pages. It allows for the identification and retrieval of specific elements like product titles, prices, and ratings based on their HTML tags and attributes. Error Handling and Rate Limiting: 
The code likely incorporates error-handling mechanisms to address issues like network errors, timeouts, or unexpected HTML changes on the website. Data Storage Format: The scraped data is stored in a structured format for further analysis. The data is saved in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format with file name "bestbuy_data.csv." 
As the data is values and not images, I have choose CSV over format. Also, CSV naturally represents data in a tabular structure, like a spreadsheet. This makes it suitable for datasets with rows and columns, such as database exports, Excel spreadsheets, or data collected from web scraping. 
**Challenges and Outlook** 
Handling road blockers: I chose Best Buy over Amazon and Walmart for web scraping primarily because Amazon and Walmart had robust firewall and robot protection systems in place, posing significant challenges during data extraction. While I could have used Selenium to bypass these barriers, I opted for Best Buy due to its website's accessibility and feasibility for scraping without encountering such blockers. This choice allowed for a smoother and more straightforward scraping process, aligning better with my project's requirements, and avoiding potential legal complications associated with Amazon and Walmart's stricter terms of service.
